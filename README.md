# Spartan 3 - Radio test
* Some ideas and test with Digilent Xilinx Spartan 3 board.
* Not real projects, only testing.
* Using VGA or audio DAC as RF signal output.

## Projects
* Reading audio from UART
* Transmitting 25 MHz carrier with button enable (manual CW)
* PS2 keyboard + RTTY transmission (595 kHz) via sound (covox) output
* RTTY test
* AM/FM modulation, modulating audio from UART
* DCF 77 generator (only physical layer, data is coming from external source)
